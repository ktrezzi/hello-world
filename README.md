# hello-world
A repository - Hopefully you come back with a smile on your face! 

Name is Andy, 29 years old, currently living in Vienna, Austria and I want to become a front-end web developer! Not surprisingly, this is my first repository. I added "Hopefully you come back with a smile", a note for myself that when I look back at my first repository in the future I will be reminded that this was my first github steps and I had no idea about it.
